                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An <span>operating system (OS)</span> is a software system that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system acts
                                    as an intermediary between the hardware and software applications, allowing them to interact with each other in a controlled manner.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operating system is responsible for a range of tasks, including managing the computer's memory, processing and scheduling tasks, managing input and output devices, and controlling network
                                    connections. It also provides a user interface, which allows users to interact with the computer system and run applications.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several types of operating systems, including desktop operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile operating systems like Android and iOS. Each operating
                                    system has its own unique features and functionality, but they all serve the same basic purpose of managing the computer's hardware and software resources. </h5>

                                <h5>Here are some interesting facts about Operating System:</h5>
                                <ol>
                                    <li> The first operating system was developed in the 1950s for the UNIVAC I computer.</li>
                                    <li> One of the most widely used operating systems in the world is Linux, which was developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.</li>
                                    <li> The most widely used desktop operating system in the world is Windows, developed by Microsoft.</li>
                                    <li> The most widely used mobile operating system is Android, developed by Google.</li>
                                    <li> Operating systems are responsible for managing computer resources such as memory, storage, and CPU time, and for providing a user interface for users to interact with their devices.</li>
                                    <li> There are different types of operating systems, including single-user, multi-user, real-time, mobile, and embedded.</li>
                                    <li> Some operating systems are open-source, meaning that their source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.</li>
                                    <li> The first versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows 1.0 and 2.0, were not true operating systems, but rather graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that ran on top of MS-DOS.</li>
                                    <li> Some operating systems are designed to be highly secure and resistant to hacking, such as Qubes OS, which uses virtualization to isolate different parts of the operating system.</li>
                                    <li> Some of the most successful and innovative companies in the world, such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google, owe much of their success to the operating systems they have developed.</li>
