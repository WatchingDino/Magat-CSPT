                                <img src="assets/img/internetofThings/iot.png" alt="" height="400" width="500" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span>Internet of Things (IoT)</span> refers to the network of physical objects, devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity
                                    that enables them to collect and exchange data. These objects are often referred to as "smart" devices, as they are capable of sensing their environment, processing data, and communicating with other devices over the
                                    internet.
                                </h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IoT is characterized by the ability to collect large amounts of data from a variety of sources, which can be analyzed and used to make more informed decisions. For example, IoT sensors
                                    in a manufacturing plant can collect data on machine performance and send it to a central system for analysis, enabling operators to identify and address issues before they result in downtime or lost productivity.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IoT is also changing the way that businesses and consumers interact with the physical world. For example, smart homes equipped with IoT devices can be controlled remotely using a smartphone
                                    app, while connected cars can provide real-time information on traffic and road conditions.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IoT is enabling a new level of automation, efficiency, and convenience in a wide range of industries and applications, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and consumer electronics.</h5>
                                <br/>
