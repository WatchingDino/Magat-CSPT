                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Directory Services</span> is a type of Security Service. Directory Services are a set of technologies and protocols that are used to manage and store information about users, resources,
                                        and other objects in a networked environment. The primary function of directory services is to provide a centralized, standardized way of managing access to resources and services across the network.</h5>
                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directory Services are typically used in enterprise environments, where there are large numbers of users and resources that need to be managed. They can help to simplify user and resource
                                        management, improve security, and increase efficiency by providing a single point of administration for network resources.</h5>
                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most widely used directory services is Active Directory, which is a directory service developed by Microsoft. Active Directory provides a centralized location for storing information

                                        property, subject to certain terms and conditions. They are often used to regulate the distribution and use of software, music, movies, and other digital content.</h5>
                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Licenses is not a security service, but they can be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy. For example, software licenses can be used to ensure that only authorized
                                        users have access to software applications, and that the software is used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Similarly, licenses for digital content can be used to prevent unauthorized distribution
                                        and piracy, which can help to protect the intellectual property rights of content creators.</h5>
