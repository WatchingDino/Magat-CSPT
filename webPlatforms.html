                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Web Platforms</span> refer to a type of software application that provides a set of tools and services for creating and managing web-based applications and websites. A web platform typically
                                    includes a combination of technologies, programming languages, and frameworks that are designed to simplify the process of building and deploying web applications.</h5>
                                <br/>

                                <div class="container" style="text-align:center;">

                                </div><br/>

                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of web platforms include content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Magento, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and cloud
                                    computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Web platforms often provide developers with pre-built components, templates, and plugins that they can use to create web applications quickly and easily. They may also offer features such
                                    as user authentication, database management, and content delivery networks (CDN) to improve website performance and security.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Web platforms are popular because they allow developers to focus on creating the functionality and features of their web applications without having to worry about underlying infrastructure
                                    and technical details. This can save time and resources and enable developers to create complex web applications more quickly and efficiently.</h5>

                                        This enables devices to perform more tasks locally, without relying on a centralized server or cloud provider.</h5>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge computing can be useful for a variety of applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. For example, sensors
                                        on a manufacturing assembly line can perform real-time data processing and analysis at the edge, allowing for faster response times and improved efficiency.</h5>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge computing can also be combined with other technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to enable more advanced data processing and analysis at the edge. This
                                        approach can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the cloud for processing, improving the speed and reliability of data processing and reducing bandwidth costs.</h5>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples of companies that provide edge computing solutions include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. These providers offer a range of tools and services
                                        for deploying and managing edge computing applications.</h5>
