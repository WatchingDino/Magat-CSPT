                                <h6> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms <span>"Gamer"</span> and <span>"Player"</span> are sometimes used interchangeably, they can have slightly different meanings depending on the context. Here are some possible differences:</h6>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Focus:</span> A gamer is someone who specifically enjoys playing video games, while a player may participate in a wider range of activities, such as sports, board games, or card games.</li>
                                    <li><span>Platform:</span> A gamer typically plays video games on consoles, computers, or mobile devices, while a player may engage in a wider range of activities that may not involve technology.</li>
                                    <li><span>Competitive vs non-competitive:</span> A player may participate in games or activities for fun, without necessarily trying to win or beat others, while a gamer may be more focused on competitive play and striving
                                        to improve their skills.
                                    </li>

                                <h4><span>Cloud Systems</span></h4>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloud systems can be used to develop mobile backends, which are server-side components of a mobile application that provide services to mobile users. Mobile backends can include features such
                                    as user authentication, data storage and retrieval, push notifications, and integration with other services and APIs.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloud systems for mobile backends typically provide developers with a range of tools and services, such as cloud storage, serverless computing, databases, and APIs, that can be used to build
                                    and deploy scalable and reliable backends for mobile applications. These cloud-based services can be accessed over the internet, and can be integrated with other cloud-based services to create a complete end-to-end
                                    solution for mobile app development.</h5>
                                <br/>
                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One popular cloud system for developing mobile backends is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers a range of services specifically designed for mobile app development, including AWS Amplify,
                                    AWS AppSync, and AWS Lambda. Other cloud systems that can be used to develop mobile backends include Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud.</h5>
