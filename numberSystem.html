                                        is stored in terms of bits and bytes. The binary number system does not deal with other numbers such as 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on. For example: 10001<sub>2</sub>, 111101<sub>2</sub>, 1010101<sub>2</sub> are some examples
                                        of numbers in the binary number system.

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The octal number system uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 with the base of 8. The advantage of this system is that it has lesser digits when compared to several other systems,
                                        hence, there would be fewer computational errors. Digits like 8 and 9 are not included in the octal number system. Just as the binary, the octal number system is used in minicomputers but with digits from 0 to 7.
                                        For example: 35
                                        <sub>8</sub>, 23<sub>8</sub>, 141<sub>8</sub> are some examples of numbers in the octal number system.</h5>

                                        systems, file permissions are represented using a 3-digit octal number, where each digit represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively.</h5>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decimal number system uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 with the base number as 10. The decimal number system is the system that we generally use to represent numbers
                                        in real life. If any number is represented without a base, it means that its base is 10. For example: 723<sub>10</sub>, 32<sub>10</sub>, 4257<sub>10</sub> are some examples of numbers in the decimal number system.

                                        numbers 10-15 of the decimal number system respectively. This system is used in computers to reduce the large-sized strings of the binary system.

                                        numbers. Because each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, or bits, groups of four binary digits can be represented using a single hexadecimal digit. This makes it easier to read and write binary numbers
                                        and perform calculations with them.</h5>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to its use in representing binary numbers, the hexadecimal number system is also used in other applications, such as color representation. In digital graphics, colors are often
                                        represented using three or four bytes, with each byte representing the intensity of the red, green, and blue color channels. Each of these bytes can be represented as two hexadecimal digits, allowing colors to be
                                        specified using a six- or eight-digit hexadecimal number. For example, the color white is represented as the hexadecimal number #FFFFFF, which represents the maximum intensity of each color channel.</h5>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hexadecimal system is also used in computer programming, particularly in low-level programming languages such as assembly language. Memory addresses and machine code instructions are
                                        often expressed as hexadecimal numbers, which are easier to read and write than binary numbers and can be converted to and from binary more easily than decimal numbers.</h5>
                                    <br/>

                                    <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the hexadecimal number system is a useful tool for working with binary numbers and is used extensively in computer science and digital electronics. Its ability to represent
                                        groups of binary digits with a single digit makes it a convenient way to work with large binary numbers, and its use in other applications such as color representation and computer programming make it a valuable

                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number system is a system of representing numbers using symbols or digits. It is a way of expressing numerical values, either by counting or measuring. Different number systems use different
                                    symbols or digits and follow different rules for combining them to represent numbers. The most common number system is the decimal system, which uses 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and is used in everyday
                                    life for counting, measuring, and making calculations. Other number systems include the binary system, which uses 2 digits (0 and 1), the octal system, which uses 8 digits (0 to 7), and the hexadecimal system, which
                                    uses 16 digits (0 to 9 and A to F). Number systems are essential to mathematics, computer science, engineering, telecommunications, finance, and many other fields where numerical data needs to be represented, manipulated,
                                    or analyzed.

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Mathematics:</span> Number systems are essential to mathematics, which uses them to represent, manipulate, and solve numerical problems.</li>
                                    <li><span>Computer Science:</span> Number systems are used extensively in computer science, especially in digital electronics, programming, and data representation. Computers use the binary number system to represent and
                                        process data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span>Telecommunications:</span> Number systems are used in telecommunications to represent analog signals as digital signals. This is achieved by sampling the analog signal at regular intervals and representing each
                                        sample as a digital number.</li>
                                    <li><span>Engineering:</span> Number systems are used in engineering for calculations, measurements, and control systems. In particular, the binary and hexadecimal number systems are commonly used in computer engineering
                                        and digital signal processing.</li>
                                    <li><span>Finance:</span> Number systems are used in finance to represent and manipulate financial data, such as currency values, interest rates, and stock prices.</li>
                                    <li><span>Science:</span> Number systems are used in science to represent and manipulate physical measurements and calculations, such as in physics, chemistry, and astronomy.</li>
                                    <li><span>Music:</span> Number systems are used in music theory to represent musical notes, intervals, and chords.</li>
                                </ul>
