                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Application Platforms</span> are frameworks of services, tools, and resources that enable developers to create, deploy, and manage software applications. These platforms provide a standardized
                                    set of tools and services for common tasks such as data management, user authentication, and application deployment.</h5>
                                <br/>

                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application platforms can be divided into different categories, such as desktop platforms, mobile platforms, web-based platforms, and cloud-based platforms. They typically include <span>Development
                                    Tools</span>, <span>Execution Services</span>, <span>Data Services</span>, <span>Operating Systems</span>, and <span>Cloud Services</span>.</h5>
                                <br/>

                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using an application platform, developers can save time and effort by not having to build and manage all the components of an application from scratch. Instead, they can focus on building
                                    the unique features and functionality of their application while leveraging the tools and resources provided by the platform.</h5>
                                <br/>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Development Tools:</span> There are several kinds of development tools -- each cater to the specific needs of developers. As examples, Appian offers low-code development combined with strong process management.
                                        Microsoft PowerApps shares similar features and ties together major services, such as Office 365, SQL Server, Dropbox. Other application platforms such as Mendix and OutSystems provide enterprise-class end-to-end
                                        software development and testing with visual application creation and comprehensive user interfaces.</li>
                                    <li><span>Execution Services:</span> Execution services are important for everyday application functions. Execution services are often related to application deployment options, such as cloud providers (including Microsoft
                                        Azure), which can host applications in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Containers are increasingly important for execution because developers can package and implement complete application components in the
                                        form of images. Containers in application platform software enable faster-paced development cycles, such as Agile and DevOps. Tools such as PowerShell can be classified as an execution service that provides administrators
                                        with the means to configure and manage underlying systems.</li>
                                    <li><span>Data Services:</span> Data services help applications to process and store information. Data services work alongside execution services and interpret information with data provided by development tools or from
                                        the cloud. Microsoft's Storage Spaces is one example of a data service. For example, Microsoft PowerApps can work with Microsoft's Common Data Service to offer a common platform for enterprise data instances.</li>
                                    <li><span>Operating systems:</span> An OS, such as Linux, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, provides the various resources to run applications, including file systems, memory management, user interface (to launch and
                                        manage applications), multitasking support, and the ability to interact with the underlying hardware.</li>
                                    <li><span>Cloud Computing Services:</span> Cloud services provide remotely accessed functions. Applications can deploy to cloud instances such as VMs and containers, but the cloud also offers many services to support application
                                        function. Apple's iCloud Drive is an example of cloud storage that stores and processes photos, videos, applications and other documents for users. Microsoft's OneDrive is another example of cloud storage as a service.
                                        Cloud services have become a trend for application platforms, mobile enterprise application platforms, and platforms as a service due to increases in mobile users. With the cloud developers can create applications
                                        so they can be accessed on multiple devices with the same functions and data involved.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These areas work together to provide a comprehensive platform for creating, executing, and managing applications. By providing a set of standard services and tools, an application platform
                                    can help developers to build applications more efficiently and effectively, while also ensuring consistency and reliability across different applications built on the same platform.</h5>
                                <br/>

                                <div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                    <h6>Not all of these resources or services are required for every application, and not every application platform provides all five resources. More complex applications require more extensive and feature-rich platforms
                                        for development than simpler apps. This means that a developer might deploy multiple application platforms to support a complex application. An application's required services can also change depending on what hardware
                                        is running it. For example, a user relies on Windows 10 to open an application through their laptop, with a web browser and Microsoft SQL Server for execution and data services. The same application opened through
                                        Microsoft Azure may use Windows as an OS and .NET and Azure SQL for execution and data services.</h6>
